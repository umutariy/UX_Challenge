        			<h2>Health and Social welfare</h2>
        			<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
                        
                        <strong>1. Health Sector</strong> <br>

                        Rwanda’s health sector, like many others in the country, has in the last decades remarkably evolved. The success is in part due to the fact that the Government and the Ministry of Health work as one in pursuit of an integrated and community-driven development process. <br><br>

                        a. Ministry of Health (MoH) <br>

                        To enhance public health services, the Ministry of Health is committed to strengthening the quality of service delivered and providing access to treatment from a bottom up approach. <br><br>

                        Each village elects three volunteers to act as Community Health Workers for the general population - a binome comprising of a man and a woman for general diseases and a woman as assistant maternal to follow antenatal care - and the first line of defence addressing 80% of the burden of disease through home-based care.  Community Health Workers are trained by the Ministry of Health throughout the country to deliver quality services, monitor health at village level and refer sick patients to the nearest health centre whereby based on the gravity of their cases they are then transferred to more specialised health facility or ultimately to a Referral Hospital. <br><br>

                        The Ministry of Health also facilitates a universal health insurance coverage commonly known as Mutuelle de Santé currently covering over 85 % of the population and 90% of their medical bill. Rwandans within their several clusters also benefit from various health insurance schemes such as RAMA/RSSB, MMI and others of the private sector. <br><br>

                        Through the above mentioned health insurance schemes, Rwandans and foreigners leaving in Rwanda are entitled to the necessary medical care from any of the 504 health centres, 501 Health Posts, 36 District Hospital 4 Provincial Hospitals and 7 Referral Hospitals in the country. <br><br>

                        Overall, Rwanda’s health system practices and policies are among the key elements which allowed the country its vibrant progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and a projection towards SDGs. <br><br>

                        Interesting statistics comparisons: <br>

                            Infant mortality: 48.6/1000 (Census, 2012) ; 32/1000 (DHS, 2014-2015) <br>
                            Under 5 Mortality: 72.3/1000 (Census, 2012) ; 50/1000 (DHS, 2014-2015) <br>
                            Maternal mortality: 476/ 100,000 (DHS , 2010) ; 210/100,000 (DHS, 2014-2015) <br>
                            Assisted deliveries: 90% (HMIS 2013) ; 91% (DHS, 2014-2015)<br><br>
